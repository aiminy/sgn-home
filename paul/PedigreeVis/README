The code for pedigree visualization is in the solgenomics/bio-geneticrelationships repository on github.

Located here is the HTML, Javascript, and CSS files that comprise a sample pedigree Visualization website/implementation.
It uses some server side scripting, so running it locally won't work. The graphviz graph files must be located in the /graphs directory,
and they must have the .gv file extension. All filenames for the files that will be loaded must also be noted in the array in pedlist.js.

To get Graphviz files to display on webpages properly, the Javascipt library Canviz must be used: http://code.google.com/p/canviz/

Currently there are Javascript hover effects in place which use the JS files main.js and popupstyle.js.
However, text pop ups might not be necessary for the final implementation. Really, all that is needed is the href property of a
Graphviz node to be set to a link to the organism or stock page which would contain the more detailed information.

If the javascript hover effects are not needed, remove the "onmouseout" and "onmouseover" attributes in Pedigree.pm. Honestly, they
are probably more trouble than they are worth. The href property is all you really need.

Selfing is denoted by a double line is the generated pedigree picture, however there won't yet be a label on the lines to denote the
number of generations of selfing. I don't know how this is represented in the database.
