famtrackgen.pl

This script generates gff3 track files for gene families to be used on GBrowse.
It takes in as input the species name, the species gff3 file which contains the coordinates for each gene/mRNA
and the gene family file, which in most cases is the orthomcl output file (e.g. all_orthomcl.out)

If a gene family is found with less than the $max_family_amount specified containing a gene/protein of the given
species, it takes the coordinates of that gene/protein and creates gff3 rows/glyphs for all other members in the family
at those coordinates.

The regular expressions used might need tweaking based on what is being used, namely with what feature type contains the coordinates of each gene/mRNA.
This script has only been used on grape and rice so far.
