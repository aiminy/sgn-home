UNIGENE ANNOTATION PIPELINE


########################
* GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
########################

  This is an old pipeline to annotate unigene sequences and load these 
annotations into SGN database. It can be divided into two subsections:

 1) blast annotations, based in the homology of the unigene sequences with
    known sequences from other databases such as GenBank, TAIR or Swissprot.

 2) protein analysis, cds and protein sequence prediction and protein domain
    analysis using InterProScan.
