UPDATE CLEANING DATA PIPELINE

* Description:
	The sequences cleaning use different datasets to find vector, adaptors, lab host contaminants, michocondrials or plastids non codificant sequences... These datasets can be change (the users can add more information or remove wrong data), and could be useful a pipeline that update these data for the sequences. This pipeline use three scripts, one to get the sequences from the database, other to clean the sequences (the same that use the trace processing pipeline) and another that store the old cleaning data in a file and update the database with the new cleaning data.

1) FIRST STEP: Get the sequences from the database.

   The script that we can use to get the sequences is SGN_get_seq-from-db.pl. This script has different option to get the sequences (with or without qscore values, get the clean sequences, get the sequence with flags=0 or/and status=0...). The rigth option for this pipeline is get the sequences without qscore values and get the crude sequences (without the aplication of the cleaning coordenates or the flags/status).

   Usage: perl /root/sgn-tools/trace_processing/to_update_cleaning/SGN_get_seq-from-db.pl 
          -H <dbhost> -D <dbname> -b <basename_for_out_file> [-o <organism_name> or -l <library_name>]

   After the use of this script, it is convenient the application of sequences analysis scripts, like fastaFileCheck. The crude sequences haven't limits in the size range (the curated, cleaned sequences should not have sequences sizes with less than 100 nt).

2) SECOND STEP: The cleaning.

   The script used for the cleaning in this pipeline is the same than the script used in the trace processing pipeline. SGN_seqclean.pl is a script that use the program seqclean to remove the contaminant sequences (vector, adaptor, lab host...), poliA tails and the sequences with less than 100 nt. See the help, perldoc of this script or the README for the trace processing for more details.

   Another script that could be used for the cleaning is the SGN_chimera_screen.pl, to find possible chimera mRNAs. See the help, perldoc of this script or the README for the trace processing for more details.

3) THIRD STEP: Update the data in the database.

   The script that we can use to update the cleaning coordenates (sgn.qc_report.hqi_start, sgn.qc_report.hqi_length) and the cleaning tags (sgn.est.status, sgn.est.tags) is SGN_update_cleancoord-in-db.pl. This script get this data from the database (sgn.est.est_id, sgn.est.status, sgn.est.flags, sgn.qc_report.qc_id, sgn.qc_report.hqi_start, sgn.qc_report.hqi_length) for the organism specified in the scripts arguments and store in a tab file. After load the new cleaning data in a master table, get the new data using individual searchs and update the sgn.est and sgn.qc_report with these data. Finally write in the screen a report of how many sgn.est and sgn.qc_entries have updated. 

   This script use as input the out tab files that make the SGN_seqclean.pl and the SGN_chimera_screen.pl scripts.
