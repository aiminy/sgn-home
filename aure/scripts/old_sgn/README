 This dir contains the old pipelines used by SGN to process, assembly and 
annotate EST sequences.


#######################
* GENERAL OVERVIEW:
#######################

  The global process is composed by three pipelines:

  1) trace_processing, to process the EST sequences (extract sequences from
     chromatograms or genbank files, remove adaptors or vectors, screening for
     contaminanats or chimeras...).

  2) unigene, to assembly EST sequences and load into the SGN database.

  3) protein, to predict cds and protein sequences from unigene and load 
     into SGN database.

  Each pipeline has one or more perl scripts. These perl scripts use some
external programs like SeqClean, Lucy, CAP3 or EstScan. See REAME file 
for each pipeline for more details.
